How to build the Cordova HelloWorld ExampleProject

* Purpose of this page
 
   This page explains how the {{{http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_getting-started_ios_index.md.html}HelloWorld project}} provided on the Cordova homepage can be built with the xcode-maven-plugin.

* The big picture

   Within the HelloWorld example provided on the Cordova homepage the CordovaLib project is embedded as source code into the HelloWorld project. The xcode-maven-plugin uses the dependency resolution mechanism provided by maven. With this approach there is no need for including dependent project on the level of the source code. Instead the dependent projects are built in there own cycle and consumed afterwards without there source code based project. This means: first we build the CordovaLib using the xcode-maven-plugin. As the result of that step the headers and the compiles library representing the CordovaLib are exposed in a binary repository.  After that we build the HelloWorld project. The HelloWorld project declares a depenency to the CordovaLib on the level of the maven project. Before the HelloWorld project is compiled the headers and the binary representing the CordovaLib are materialized into the HelloWorldProject. In order to get this working we need to adjust the header search path and the library search path accordingly.
      
* How it works

   Unzip the {{{./BuildCordovaWithMaven.zip}attached zip file}} in an arbitrary folder, cd into the bin directory and run <<<./all.sh $\{CORODVA_VERSION\} >>>. CORDOVA_VERSION is the latest version of the cordova library.

   If you are behind a firewall adjust the HTTP_PROXY in file <<<bin/prepareCordova.sh>>>.

   This shell script 

   * downloads the {{{http://www.apache.org/dist/cordova/}Cordova sources}}.

   * mavenizes the CordovaLib project (relocated the project sources to <<<src/xcode>>>, adds the pom file.).

   * builds the CordovaLib project with maven.

   * creates the HelloWorld project as described {{{http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_getting-started_ios_index.md.html#Getting%20Started%20with%20iOS_project_creation}here}}

   * mavenizes the HelloWorld project. (Relocated the sources to <<<src/xcode>>>, adds the pom file. During this step the embedded CordovaLib project is removed).

   * Builds the HelloWorld project with maven.

   []

   After calling the script the
   
   * CordovaLib project is located inside <<<./projects/CordovaLib>>>

   * HelloWorld project is located inside <<<./projects/HelloWorld>>>

   []

   As always: the best documentation is the source code. Please review the shell scripts and the pom files that can be found inside the mavenized projects.
