* 1.9.1

** Features

*** Support alternate public header path

  Some Xcode libraries create a namespacing for their header files in the build process by 
  putting the header files inside a directory structure according to the namespacing policy. 
  In order to reflect the namespacing in the packaged header tar files created by the xcode-maven-plugin, 
  it is required to provide a parent folder of the <<<PUBLIC_HEADER_FOLDER_PATH>>> as it is defined 
  in the xcode project. With this alternate public header path the headers are packaged containing 
  the remaining part of the folder structure below the alternate public header folder path. 
  The alternate public header path has to be defined into the plugin configuration as 
  <<<alternatePublicHeaderFolderPath>>> in the plugin configuration. This alternate public 
  header path must be a parent folder of the public header path into Xcode. 

*** OTA Service

  The {{{http://velocity.apache.org/}Velocity}} template used to generate the over-the-air deployment HTML page is now configurable.
  This way the Velocity template can be changed without the need to release and use a new version of 
  the Xcode Maven plugin.
  To specify a Velocity template path set an absolute path via the property <<<mios.ota-service.buildHtmlTemplate>>>.  
  
  E.g. <<<mvn clean install -Dmios.ota-service.buildHtmlTemplate=/Users/myuser/otaBuildTemplate.html>>>
  
  You can use any properties and environment variables inside the {{{http://velocity.apache.org/}Velocity}} template.

*** Support of transitive archive (zip) components

  You could now use archive components containing for example specific Html5 content - you 
  could decide whether to copy, unpack or use as a bundle such a component.

** Bug Fixes

*** Wrong file pointers

  During the deployment of files into a remote repository we listen to deploy actions and 
  create pointer files pointing to the deployed artifacts. These pointer files resides on 
  the build server and simplifies the retrieval of artifacts inside nexus. In case of multi 
  module builds all pointer files pointed to the artifacts of the last project in the module. 
  With this fix each pointer file points to the artifact it should point to.

* 1.8.0

** Features

*** Xcode settings and options

  Xcode settings and options can now be handed over from command line or from the settings.xml.
  Settings and options provided this way supersedes settings and options provided in the xcodeproject
  itself or in the projects pom file.
  
  Settings and options can be provided from the command line with <<<-Dxcode.settings.NAME=VALUE>>> 
  or in this settings.xml in the properties section <<<<xcode.settings.NAME>VALUE</\>>>>. 
  For options use prefix <<<xcode.options>>> accordingly. 

** Bug Fixes

*** Symbolic links do not work in local builds

  With version 1.5.1 symbolic links for headers and libraries have been introduced inside target/headers 
  and target/libs. When new dependencies are added to the project and mvn clean initialize is called, the 
  binaries and the headers were symbolic linked inside the target folder. By linking this libraries in Xcode, 
  the symbolic links are resolved which finally leads to paths pointing to locations outside the project. Usage 
  of symbolic links is now disabled by default for local builds and can be switched on with property 
  <<<xcode.useSymbolicLinks>>>. If the flag is set to true symbolic links are used.
  
  Into the central build, the <<<xcode.useSymbolicLinks>>> property is set to true for improving the build 
  time and the required disk space. 

*** Wrong packaging of dSYM bundles
  
  Fix packaging the dSYM bundle. The dSYM bundle is deployed as a zip archive in Nexus. This zip file was 
  packaged with incorrect structure, i.e after unzipping you did not have folder named 
  <<<\<your-product-name>.app.dSYM>>> and had to manually restore it in order to be able to analyze crash reports, 
  received from customers.
