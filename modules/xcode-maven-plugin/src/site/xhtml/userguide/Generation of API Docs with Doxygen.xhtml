<title>Generation of API Docs with Doxygen</title>
</head>

<body>

	<p>This page gives you an overview how to enable Doxygen
		documentation generation for XCode Projects for Libraries.</p>

	<h1>Generation of Doxygen Documentation</h1>



	<p>
		API docs can be created and packaged with the maven-doxygen-plugin
		together with the maven-assembly-plugin. In a first step the
		maven-doxygen-plugin generates the api-doc. In a second step the
		maven-assembly-plugin packages that documentation and attaches it as
		side artifact.<br /> Both plugins are preconfigured inside the xcode
		parent pom file.
	</p>

	<h4>Activation of doxygen generation</h4>

	<p>
		In order to activate the doxygen generation for your library project,
		a flag file named "generate-doxygen" has to be present beside the
		project pom file. <br /> <img src="images/generate-doxygen.png"
