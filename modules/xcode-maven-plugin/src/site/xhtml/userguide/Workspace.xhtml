<title>Develop Multiple Dependent Xcode Projects</title>
</head>

<body>

	<p>This page gives you an overview how to develop multiple
		dependent Xcode projects at once.</p>

	<h3>Local Development Environment</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Open the first project in Xcode.</li>
		<li>Save it as a new workspace (<span>File</span> -> <span>Save
				as Workspace...</span>)
		</li>
		<li>Drag and Drop the second project into the workspace.</li>
	</ul>
<br />

<br />
<i>Make sure that the second project is added to the workspace and
		not to the first project!</i>
<br />
	Right:

	<br />
	<br /> 
	Wrong:
	<br />
	<img src="images/workspace_wrong.png" style="border: 1px solid black" />
<br />
<br />
Ensure that <span>Find Implicit Dependencies</span> is checked (<span>Product</span>
		-> <span>Edit Scheme...</span> -> <span>Build</span>).

<br />
		Xcode resolves dependencies automatically between your projects and
		rebuilds them if needed.

	<h3>Maven Build Environment</h3>

	<p>
		Currently, it is not possible to build a workspace with the MiOS
		infrastructure. The projects must be built independently and deployed
		to Nexus. Therefore the explicit settings, required for the maven
		build must still be configured. When used together with the workspace, the
		explicit project settings are overwritten by the workspace handling.
		Therefore for local development scenario, using a workspace, the
		project resolution is done by the workspace settings and the maven
		builds using the settings, configured for the projects.
