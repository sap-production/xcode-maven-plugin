<title>Generation and Consumption Libraries with Bundles</title>
</head>

<body>

	<p>This page gives you an overview how to produce bundles from
		XCode Projects for Libraries and how to consume them out of a XCode
		Application. This feature is available starting with version 1.1.0 of
		the Maven Xcode Plugin.</p>

	<h2>Exposing Bundle Resources</h2>

		<pre>
      |-- project-root
        |-- src
        |  |-- xcode                              The <span>"xcode"</span> folder contains the whole XCode project. Copy your project here.
        |     |-- &lt;sources&gt;, ...
        |     |-- MyNewProject.xcodeproj
        |     |-- MyNewProject.bundle             This folder contains the <span>default</span> bundle to be packaged <span>for</span> the library. Optional.
        |     |-- &lt;AdditionalBundle1.bundle&gt;      Additional bundles could be defined in parallel folders or in sub-folders
        |     |-- Resources
                 |-- &lt;AdditionalBundle2.bundle&gt;
        |     |-- MyNewProjectTests
        |        |-- &lt;sources&gt;, ...
        |      .....
        |
        |-- pom.xml                               The pom.xml has to be created on the same level as the <span>"src"</span> folder
</pre>


	<h3>Default Bundle</h3>

	<p>
		The bundle, located parallel to the
		<tt>MyNewProject.xcodeproj</tt>
		and called
		<tt>MyNewProject.bundle</tt>
		will be packaged automatically during the library build from the Maven
		Xcode Plugin. No configuration steps needed.
	</p>

	<h3>Additional Bundles</h3>

	<p>
		A Library project could expose arbitrary number of bundles. In this
		case they must be explicitly declared in your
		<tt>pom</tt>
		file.
	</p>

	<p>Example snippet:</p>
	<div>
		<div>
			<b>pom.xml</b>
		</div>
		<div>
			<pre>
....
      <span>&lt;build&gt;</span>
          <span>&lt;plugins&gt;</span>
              <span>&lt;plugin&gt;</span>
                  <span>&lt;groupId&gt;</span>com.sap.prd.mobile.ios.mios<span>&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
                  <span>&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>xcode-maven-plugin<span>&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
                  <span>&lt;extensions&gt;</span>true<span>&lt;/extensions&gt;</span>
                  <span>&lt;configuration&gt;</span>
                    <span>&lt;bundles&gt;</span>
                      <span>&lt;bundle&gt;</span>AdditionalBundle1<span>&lt;/bundle&gt;</span>
                      <span>&lt;bundle&gt;</span>Resources/AdditionalBundle2<span>&lt;/bundle&gt;</span>
                    <span>&lt;/bundles&gt;</span>
                  <span>&lt;/configuration&gt;</span>
              <span>&lt;/plugin&gt;</span>
               ....
          <span>&lt;/plugins&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/build&gt;</span>
</pre>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2>Using Bundle Resources</h2>

	<h3>
		Prerequisites
	</h3>

	<p>
		The dependent project is already specified in the
		<tt>dependencies</tt>
		section of the pom.xml.
	</p>

	<h3>Maven initialize</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Open a Terminal and go to the folder containing the pom.xml.</li>
		<li>Run the following command:<br /> <tt>mvn initialize</tt></li>
		<li>After this execution a "target" folder is created in your
			project folder, where all bundles additionally to all archives and
			headers from the dependent projects are downloaded.<br /><img
					src="images/bundles.jpg"
					style="border: 1px solid black" />
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Bundles in XCode</h3>

	<p>In the XCode IDE, just drag and drop the bundles you need into
		your project.</p>
