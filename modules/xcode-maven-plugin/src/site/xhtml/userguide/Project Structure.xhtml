	<p>This document describes how to prepare your XCode project to be
		aligned with the project structure defined for MiOS Infrastructure.</p>

	<h2>MiOS Project Structure</h2>

	<p>The folder structure on your local filesystem has to be the
		following:</p>

	<pre>
    |-- project-root
      |-- src
      |  |-- xcode                              The <span>"xcode"</span> folder contains the whole XCode project. Copy your project here.
      |     |-- MyNewProject
      |        |-- &lt;sources&gt;, ...
      |     |-- MyNewProject.xcodeproj
      |     |-- MyNewProjectTests
      |        |-- &lt;sources&gt;, ...
      |      .....
      |
      |-- pom.xml                               The pom.xml has to be created on the same level as the <span>"src"</span> folder
	</pre>
	<p>
		<em>Note:</em> It is not possible to have multiple XCode projects in
		one "src/xcode" folder.<br /> Module builds are allowed. For more
