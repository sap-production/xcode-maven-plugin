# Xcode Maven Plugin

## Finally..!! This repo can atlast be retired..!!
The way xcode-maven-plugin building a project (generation of .app and archive to ipa) is no more supported by apple. Generated ipa is not  eligible for appStore upload. Changes around the xcode are very dynamic it's not realistic to adopt these changes to xcode-maven-plugin.

Please refer for Apple's latest [App Distribution Workflow](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH1-SW1)

## Overview

* Dependency resolution via a Maven repository between Xcode projects

## Known Limitations

* The xcode-maven-plugin is currently only compatible with maven 3.0. For more details check https://github.com/sap-production/xcode-maven-plugin/issues/131
* The xcode-maven-plugin is currently only compatible with Jdk 1.7.X, Project will build successfully with Jdk 8 but integration tests are failing, We recommend to use Jdk 1.7.x.
